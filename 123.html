            Mohenjo-daro meaning 'Mound of the Dead Men' is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh,
            <a href="Pakistan.html" target="_parent">Pakistan.</a>
            Built
            around 2500 BCE, it was one of
            the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, with features such as standardized
            bricks,
            street
            grids, and covered sewerage systems. It was one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous
            with
            the
            civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned
            in
            the
            19th
            century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the
            1920s.
            Significant
            excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World
            Heritage
            Site
            in
            1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.
